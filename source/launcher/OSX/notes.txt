The standalone launcher was created using pyinstaller.  For this to work on OSX, see
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/62203321/pyinstaller-giving-error-error-loading-python-no-suitable-image-found

This requires installing Apple's Xcode command line tools using
xcode-select --install

Then use homebrew to (re)install Python and pyinstaller?
pip3 uninstall pyinstaller
brew reinstall python
brew install pyinstaller

Also, pyinstaller creates its own virtual environment, so the docker package needs to be installed in that environment.
When using the pyinstaller version of the launcher, it seems to start in the directory /Users/<current user>.

To build the standalone executable on OSX, change to the OSX directory and use
pyinstaller -n CannR --onefile --windowed --noconfirm --add-data "../folder3.png:." --clean ../launcher.py

To create the .dmg file, copy the CannR.app folder to the dmg directory and then follow the directions at
