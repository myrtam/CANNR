# cannr
This is the CANNR TM tool for converting R and Python code into microservices.  The CANNR tool takes functions in R and Python source files and creates scalable containerized microservices that expose things like models and calculations so that they may be easily consumed by software applications.

You need to have Python 3.7 or higher installed.  Also, you need to install the stdlib_list package, using e.g.,
pip3 install stdlib_list
