Title: IO Functions for CANNR TM R Services
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Pat Tendick
Maintainer: Pat Tendick <ptendick@gmail.com>
Description: This package contains functions that convert between JSON input and output
    to and from service calls and R objects.  For example, the CANNR user might specify
    that a function takes a data frame as input and returns a vector as output.
    The functions in this package would convert the JSON provided in the service call
    into a data frame to be input into the function, and then would convert the vector
    output of the function into JSON to be returned by the Web service.
    This package is not intended to be used outside of the CANNR containerized services.
Imports:
    jsonlite,
